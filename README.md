# ArtefattoUIKit

SwiftUI can work together with UIKit by making it easier to add SwiftUI views to UIKit 
and visa versa using a few extensions shared there.

What I implemented in this app:
1- Tab bar 
2- Navigation Controller
3- Image Picker (you can also crop the image)
4- VideoPlayer (AVKit) / SwiftUi integrated in UIKit
5- Simple Button with a modal
